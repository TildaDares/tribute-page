<p class="padding">When I first saw this project for the tribute page on freecodecamp I had no idea who the page was going
to be about. It took me three days to come up with this and what baffled was how long it took me to come up with
this subject. A subject that I see everyday, laugh with, look up to and will soon become.</p>
<p class="padding">So this tribute is for every woman - cis, trans, queer, old, young, mothers, sheroes, sisters and daughters. To the women
who are unapolegitically resillient...</p>
<h2 id="herstory">Who is a Woman?</h2>
<p class="padding">When you hear the word woman what comes to your mind? A person with a vagina? A person who looks a certain way?
 I used to define women by what sexual organ they had but now I know that being a woman is much more than having a vagina. A woman is
 defined by her heart.</p>
<p class="padding">A woman is strong, resillient, able to push past any stereotypes society expects her to fit in. She is a warrior and a queen. 
She alone decides who she wants to be. But as much as women share these attributes they also have unique traits that make them who they are.
When I think about my mum or my sisters the first word that comes to mind is resillience. They have passed through so many storms and come out stronger
than ever. I look up to them and one day hope to become warriors just like them.</p>
<p class="padding">We all have women in our lives that we love and respect. It could be our teacher, mother, sister, aunt or friend. Why not take
 the time to tell them how much they mean to you. A kind word could go a long way.</p>
 <p class="padding">This is a poem about women written by a wonderful poet: </p>

 <section class="lineheight">
 <p class="padding poem">I am a strong, independent woman</p>
<p>Let me repeat myself</p>
<p>You obviously werenâ€™t listening</p>
<p>I am a strong independent woman</p>
<p>Regardless of the words you are telling me that "the sky's the limit"</p>
<p>When i know i can reach for the stars</p>
<p>But your actions are holding me back like gravity</p>
<p>A force meant to be defied</p>
<p>And I will defy  your disrespect, mistreatment and misunderstanding</p>
<p>I am strong because I am not afraid to break a nail</p>
<p>To get down and dirty</p>
<p>In fact I will claw, punch and kick my way through your barriers to lead to the top of it all</p>
<p>To my destiny</p>
<p>I will break the chains of social injustice that restrict me</p>
<p>from reaching my dreams and aspirations</p>
<p>I will break free from the cage of your gender stereotypes</p>
<p>I may be a woMAN, a feMALE but you will no longer define me</p>
<p>I am a strong, independent woman</p>
<p>I am independent because I defy those old Disney princess fantasies</p>
<p>You see, I will stop my wicked witch, slay my dragon, and still have time to run my kingdom</p>
<p>I don't need prince charming to save me</p>
<p>And i wont be defined by my shoe size</p>
<p>I am independent because I can think for myself</p>
<p>I don't need Cosmo, 17 nor Vogue to tell me how to dress</p>
<p>I don't need the media to tell me how to look</p>
<p>I don't live in the Malibu Dream House</p>
<p>I don't come with accessories</p>
<p>I will never be Barbie</p>
<p>She's perfect plastic and fake fantasies</p>
<p>While I'm the real deal</p>
<p>I am more than what you see</p>
<p>I am more than my face</p>
<p>I am strong because i can bleed for 5 days and 4 nights and only get so much as a cramp</p>
<p>I can endure the pain of my body being ripped open just to give birth</p>
<p>And underneath all the screams and blood splatter is a woman turned into a mother</p>
<p>I am more than my body</p>
<p>I am a temple that deserves respect</p>
<p>I am brought by Adam</p>
<p>But made HERstory by Eve</p>
<p>And none shall enter my garden</p>
<p>I am not a tool for your pleasure</p>
<p>I am not your servant, maid or chef</p>
<p>I won't fix your breakfast</p>
<p>I won't make your bed</p>
<p>My many uses aren't to be used by you</p>
<p>Don't call me baby, or babe</p>
<p>Do not undermine me</p>
<p>For I am powerful beyond belief</p>
<p>I am a strong, independent woman</p>
<p>I am strong because I am connected to my inner being</p>
<p>my spiritual surroundings and with life all around</p>
<p>Yes, I may live in my emotions sometimes, and you may scrutinize my expression</p>
<p>But I can walk with my head held high and a smile on my face</p>
<p>I have a voice</p>
<p>I have mind</p>
<p>I have a soul</p>
<p>None of which you can control</p>
<p>I will strike you down with my very last breath</p>
<p>Never hesitating to become the woman I'm meant to be</p>
<p>I am strong and independent</p>
<p>I am woman</p>
